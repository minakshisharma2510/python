Single Inheritance Programs:

1)

Animal is the base class with a constructor _init_ and a method speak.
Dog is the derived class that inherits from the Animal class using the syntax class Dog(Animal):.
The Dog class has its own implementation of the speak method, which overrides the method in the base class.
An instance of the Dog class, named Buddy, is created.
When calling the speak method on the dog_instance, it invokes the overridden method in the Dog class.
